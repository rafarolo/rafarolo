## About / Summary
I'm a backend developer with 16 years of experience in Java and 3 years focused on Kotlin with Spring. I build scalable applications, robust APIs and systems with emphasis on performance, reliability and observability — combining engineering best practices, automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.

I'm currently diving into the world of AI to leverage it for accelerating deliveries, automating and reviewing legacy code, and assisting with problem triage and code reviews.

16 years with Java; 3 years with Kotlin + Spring (Boot / Cloud / Data).

- Architecture for backend systems, REST/GraphQL APIs, microservices, observability and CI/CD automation.
